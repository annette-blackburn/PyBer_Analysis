# Module 5 Challenge: PyBer

## Overview of Analysis

To create a summary DataFrame of the PyBer ride-sharing data by city type in order to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results: Differences in Ride-Sharing Data Among Different City Types

Urban cities has the highest number of rides (1,625), drivers (59,602), and total fares ($39,854.38), while rural cities have the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) and average fare per driver ($8.06). It makes sense that a more densely populated city type would have more rides, drivers, and total fares, while a less densely populated area (that’s also more geographically spread out) would have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

For rural cities, there were 125 rides between 537 drivers for the total fare of $4,327.93. The average fare per ride was $34.62 and the average fare per driver was $8.06.

For suburban cities, there were 625 rides between 8,580 drivers for the total fare of $19,356.33. The average fare per ride was $30.97 and the average fare per driver was $2.26.

For urban cities, there were 1625 rides between 59,602 drivers for the total fare of $39,854.38. The average fare per ride was $24.53 and the average fare per driver was $0.67.

## Recommendation Summary for Addressing Any Disparities Among the City Types:

Given that urban, suburban, and rural areas are vastly different in density and area size, there is no way to address disparities among the city types nor would it make sense to, from a financial and business standpoint. My recommendation is to address any disparities *within* the city types (e.g., instead of comparing apples and oranges or urban and rural cities, compare apples to apples or urban cities to other urban cities). For example, if New York City and San Francisco, which are similarly densely populated, have disparities in total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver, some recommendations include: 
1. Increase PyBer’s advertising in the city with fewer drivers, rides, etc., by including more physical advertisements (billboards, signs)
2. Increase PyBer’s online presence in those cities (paid ads on social media, more emails to riders)
3. Increase PyBer’s drivers’ pay or incentivize the drivers with increased pay during higher traffic times of day
